## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ccosgro1/ccosgro1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Colleen Cosgrove. I completed my PhD in ecology from Kent State in 2022 (see the following repositories). Currently, I am working as a Post Doc at the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg Univerity. Thie role began as an analysis of nutrient load estimators and determining the best sampling frequency regimes. 

Currently, we have been working on data accessibility and visualization. I've been very excited to build a dashboard that allows us and many of our collaborators, angency members, and farmers to explore, use, and work with our data!
